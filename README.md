📧 Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning :
This project aims to classify emails as spam or ham using natural language processing (NLP) and a supervised learning approach. The model is trained using a labeled dataset and applies TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression for classification.

📁 Files
Spam_Mail.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing the entire code pipeline.
mail_data.csv: Dataset with labeled email messages (required to run the notebook).

🧠 Features
